# List of projects

## Current project: [Match-words-browser-game](https://github.com/Dmutre/Match-words-bworser-game)
I am working on this project for my term paper. It's the first time I have used Node.js to send files to a client and receive responses. Additionally, I have utilized file streams to read a text file from the file system.
## Past project: [Graph-linked-list-windows.h](https://github.com/Dmutre/C-larbs)
In this project, I implemented data structures for a linked list and graph in C. I used arrays of nodes to represent vertices of the graph. I also worked with the windows.h library and created a window application in C, where I could visualize the necessary information. I employed BFS, DFS, and Prim's algorithm for graph traversal.
## My common project with friend: [Alch-vs-goblins-game](https://github.com/BbIXOD/Alch)
Game made in Unity. Simple RPG. First try.
## My early projects:
* [Grosery-list](https://github.com/Dmutre/Grosery-list)
* [Quote-generator](https://github.com/Dmutre/Quote-generator)
* [Hex-colors](https://github.com/Dmutre/Hex-colors)
* [Console-Math-Game-C-sharp](https://github.com/Dmutre/Console-Math-Game-C-sharp)

In these projects, I practiced C#, CSS, HTML, and JS for web development. Some of them may contain errors, so feel free to review, fork, and submit pull requests. I would love to see your contributions!
