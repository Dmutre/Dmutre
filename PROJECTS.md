# List of projects

## Current project: [Book-catalog]([https://github.com/Dmutre/Match-words-bworser-game](https://github.com/Dmutre/Book-catalog))
Good practice for MVC pattern, EJS and creating project as full stack developer.
## Past project: [Graph-linked-list-windows.h](https://github.com/Dmutre/C-larbs)
In this project, I implemented data structures for a linked list and graph in C. I used arrays of nodes to represent vertices of the graph. I also worked with the windows.h library and created a window application in C, where I could visualize the necessary information. I employed BFS, DFS, and Prim's algorithm for graph traversal.
## My common project with friend:
[Alch-vs-goblins-game](https://github.com/BbIXOD/Alch). Game made in Unity. Simple RPG. First try.
[Match-Word-discord-bot](https://github.com/Patriot0911/MW-discord-bot). Discord bot, based on my Node.js server ([Match-words-browser-game](https://github.com/Dmutre/Match-words-bworser-game))
## My early projects:
* [Grosery-list](https://github.com/Dmutre/Grosery-list)
